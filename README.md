This is a simple demonstration of deep Q learning. The goal of the car is to travel between the top left and bottom right corners of the screen while trying to avoid the lines you draw. While the car can go through the lines, it slows it down. Press clear to clear the board. Press "save" to save your current "a.i. brain". Press load to load the saved "a.i. brain". Press plot and then draw some lines.

The learning curve to start is slow, so I included an already trained "a.i. brain". Just click load at the start and it will already have some knowledge on how to avoid the lines. Otherwise it can take a while to learn to avoid the lines and to find the corners.

I did not design the GUI or the car. Credit goes to Hadelin de Ponteves and Kirill Eremenko. I just implemented the deep Q learning for the car.
